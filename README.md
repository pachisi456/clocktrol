# Clocktrol

My first Flutter project for tracking the productive and unproductiv time of my workday.

## Getting Started

- Add `.env` file with your Clockify API key as follows if you have one.

```
CLOCKIFY_API_KEY=YourClockifyApiKey
```

- Add `google-services.json` pointing to Firebase backend into `android/app` (or for iOS follow [these steps](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=ios)).

- Run `flutter run`.
